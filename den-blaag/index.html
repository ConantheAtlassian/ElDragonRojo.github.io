<p>Many moons ago, I started blogging again with two humorous ideas: to use iWeb, and to use a title that is completely unacceptable in mixed company. While these things continue to amuse me, they tend to confound people in a way that is unnecessary for much of what I have to say.</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought it a good idea to create a second blog using normal blogging software and a normal name. Think of these two blogs as being like conversations with and without swearing. Swearing is always satisfying, but in some conversations, it just holds you back.</p>
<p>Chief among conversations that do not require swearing are the thoughts and process behind the Appsterdam movementâ€”our attempt to give the app industry a center of gravity, the way movies have Hollywood, the way musicals have Broadway.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
