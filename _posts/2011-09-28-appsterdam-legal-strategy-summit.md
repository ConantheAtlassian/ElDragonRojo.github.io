<strong>What would you ask a room full of patent attorneys?</strong>

Since <a href="http://mur.mu.rs/?p=303">announcing</a> the <a href="http://appsterdamlegalfoundation.org/">Appsterdam Legal Defense Initiative</a>, the response has been tremendous. From ideas to volunteers, from criticisms to donations, we've appreciated all of it. Now it's time to make something of all this. To that end we're getting App Makers together with a roomful of attorneys from around the world at the landmark <a href="http://maps.google.nl/maps/place?q=waag+society&hl=nl&cid=5205723124442270295">Waag building<a> on October 3-4. We'll be discussing strategies, turning our vague notions into legal opinions, and answering questions. 

We understand that if you're not in the city you're probably not going to fly out for this, especially since you're already coming out here November 4-6 for the Appsterdam 2 Launch Party Weekend. Still, you'd like to get your questions answered, and you'd like them to be answered when you're awake. Have no fear. We've considered the best way for everyone to get their questions answered, while preserving anonymity. 

Just send us your questions. We'll coalesce the things people want to know into one big anonymous blob. Then we'll use that blob to produce content during the summit that will be available online at 10 a.m. California time, two hours per day, both days. We will make sure your questions are addressed. 

At the Appsterdam Foundation, we ask ourselves, what do App Makers need? In the same way, your delegates at the legal summit are going to be asking themselves, what do App Makers need to defend themselves against patent extortion? If you have some thoughts on that, by all means, send them along.

You can use the <a href="http://appsterdamlegalfoundation.org/signup">signup form</a> to get your question across. If you've already signed up, that's OK. Or, you can <a href="mailto:contact@appsterdamlegalfoundation.org
?subject=Anthill%20Questions">email us</a>. You can also tweet <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/optanthill">@optanthill</a> or use the hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23anthill">#anthill</a><strong></strong>.

For <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/ultimate%20win/s_k_p/hellokittychainsaw.jpg">ultimate win</a>, come on over and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/33345872/">join us in person</a>.
