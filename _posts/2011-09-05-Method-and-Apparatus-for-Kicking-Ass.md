Title:
Method and Apparatus for Kicking Ass

Body:
The past few weeks have been very dark indeed. Rovio and others targeted by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jul/22/angry-birds-maker-rovio-sued-by-lodsys">new lawsuits</a>, Craig Hockenberry predicting <a href="http://furbo.org/2011/07/13/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-independent-developer/">doom</a>, and Matt Gemmell's <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/05/23/makers-and-takers">morale</a> falling like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a>. The only thing keeping me from joining my colleagues in abject depression is working for an 11th hour rally.

<strong>Rally time starts now.</strong>

Intellectual Ventures and their ilk are many tentacled beasts who use thousands of shell companies to do their dirty work. When they send blood-sucking tentacles like Lodsys into our community, we need to cut them off. 

Eventually the head will figure out to stop losing tentacles. Eventually the patent trolls will learn to avoid indies the way dogs in East Texas learn to avoid anthills.

Of course patent trolls are more likely to be from California than from Texas, so they might not know about the anthills. I actually spent part of my childhood in Texas, and learned the hard way that if you step on an anthill you'll soon be covered in swarming, biting ants. You could, in theory, crush them one by one, but it's much easier to just avoid anthills.

Let App Makers be as the ants of East Texas, minding their business until someone invades their anthill. Then Swarm! Swarm! Swarm! We will let the patent trolls know: if you attack one indie, you attack all indies, and we will file every motion we can against you, we will attack your patents, and we will show you for the mafioso thugs you are.

Our general in this fight is Michael McCoy, a Longhorn Texas technology attorney who is also conveniently licensed in California. We've been meeting in Amsterdam to hammer out a strategy and form a plan for immediate action.

When he returns to work next week, Michael will assemble and lead the Appsterdam Legal Defense Team, establish the Appsterdam Legal Defense Fund, and start implementing our strategy, codenamed Operation Anthill.

Legal action and education will be the start. We will also consider other ways of protecting ourselves, such as pushing for legislative reform. Of course, our enemies are both wealthier and better connected than we are, so will have to take our story to the people, let the public know that small businesses, jobs, and the economy are being threatened by parasitesâ€”and pray that democracy can still prevail.

We must move the fight away from the story that has been conceived by our enemies. This isn't a patent infringement issue. There's nothing most of the affected App Makers could have done to avoid being targeted. This is extortion, plain and simple, with the familiar twist of misappropriating the law to harass the very innovators patents are meant to protect.

NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/07/26/138576167/when-patents-attack">primed the pump</a> of public awareness with the latest episode of This American Life, "<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/when-patents-attack">When Patents Attack!</a>" Ready or not, the time to act is now. I propose a tongue-in-check brown ribbon campaign to raise awareness. Brown? Obviously.

<strong>Software patents are bullshit.</strong>
