By all indications the first course at <strong>Big Nerd Ranch Appsterdam</strong> was a smashing success. I have every reason in the world to be biased, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/isutton/status/130200996193374208">students</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/akulbe/status/129984167676088320">are</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattfgl/status/129834849912631296">happy</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronhillegass/status/128165046621708289">boss is happy</a>, so I'm happy too. The next Big Nerd Ranch Appsterdam course will be <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/classes/beginning_ios_iphone_ipad_">December 2-9</a>.

Just in time to get back to planning the follow-up to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/venturebeat/2011/06/27/27venturebeat-appsterdam-a-haven-for-indie-app-makers-89100.html">the greatest tech launch party ever</a>, <a href="http://meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/36497712/">the greatest tech launch party ever</a>. I was hesitant to say we were going to outdo ourselves until I got back from the ranch, took a look at the sponsor list, and got a full status report.



Now I can say without reservation that if you miss this weekend's <strong>Appsterdam 2 Launch Party Weekend</strong>, you're missing the <em>nerd party of the year</em>. I would say the nerd party of the decade, except at this rate I'm assuming we're going to have an Appsterdam 3 Launch Party Weekend next spring.



<strong>This is important:</strong> we're about to blast this information to the media, so the quickly dwindling available slots are going to run out fast. We are expecting the events to fill up quickly, so you need to <em>act now and be sure to RSVP</em>. If you're not on the list there's a very good chance you'll be waiting outside.
