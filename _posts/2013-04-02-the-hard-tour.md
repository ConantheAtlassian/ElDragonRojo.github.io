The days are getting longer and warmer, the new version of <a href="http://le.mu.rs/chemistry">Lemurs Chemistry</a> is almost complete, and it's time to start touring again. I thought I was going to be talking about monads this year, but things have gotten so hard in our industry lately, I'm going to talk about that instead. I'm not doing a lot of speaking this year, so these are some of few chances to see me on stage.

<strong>Appsterdam Birthday Bash</strong> April 20 in Amsterdam

The City of Amsterdam's famous canals are 400 years old this year, and we are two! It's hard to believe it's been two years since we started the Appsterdam movement. It's going to be amazing to look back at how far we've come, and how the organization and its goals have evolved. It's also an important time to look at what Appsterdam means to us, and where we need it go in the future.

There are a limited number of <a href="http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/103837002/">tickets available</a> for the low, low price of €15. The Appsterdam Foundation has been planning a really nice evening, and given how many folks are coming from all over to attend, the networking opportunities should be as good as the show itself. Don't miss it!

<strong>GOTO Chicago</strong> April 23 in Chicago

Missing GOTO considered harmful! The GOTO conference and its counter-clockwise cousin, YOW!, are the biggest and best general technology conferences in the world, run by some of the most genuinely nice, community-centered organizers I have ever met. Here I'll be giving a keynote about the App Universe After the Big Bang, where I'll talk about the state of our rapidly shifting industry.

You can <a href="http://gotocon.com/chicago-2013/">save $150</a> off the cost of admission with the discount code LEE150. I was born outside Chicago, and launched my speaking career at the C4 conference in Chicago. I could not be more thrilled to be returning to the Windy City—especially now that it's home to one of the most active Appsterdam embassies.

<strong>360 Intersect</strong> April 28 in Seattle

Over the past few years, conference talks have been getting less and less technical, a trend that conference organizers around the world have collectively decided to put a stop to this year. Always looking to fill voids, John and Nicole Wilker of the excellent 360 conferences have decided to try a non-technical technical conference. I think it's a great idea, and am giving it my full support.

Here you can get <a href="http://www.360intersect.com">20% off</a> the ticket price with the discount code BMF. I'm going to be giving a very intimate keynote called Insane and Back Again, where I talk about some of the crazy things I've experienced in these past few years of travel. These are the stories I'm not comfortable blogging about, but speaking at 360 has always felt like talking to a roomful of friends, and I can think of no better place to give this special, one-time-only talk.

<strong>MobiDevDay</strong> May 4 in Detroit

When I first started Appsterdam, Andy Ihnatko asked me why I didn't start it in Detroit. Somehow, that opened up a soft spot in me that remains undiminished even after what happened the <a href="http://mur.mu.rs/597">last time</a> I was there. I'm pleased to finally deliver something for the Motor City by participating in <a href="http://mobidevdaydetroit.com">MobiDevDay</a>, joining what promises to be an amazing array of speakers.

I'm giving a talk called Engineering is Hard, where I'll be talking about the things we go through in order to deliver our products, pay our rent, and make the world a better place. In the vein of the title, which you might recognize this as a saying I've borrowed from a friend, I'll be sharing a lot of great advice I've collected from engineers around the world on making a living in these crazy times.

<strong>AltWWDC</strong> June ? in San Francisco 

WWDC tickets went so fast last year, our ears popped, and just like that, the whole idea of WWDC changed forever. What used to be a chance to get the latest news from Apple has turned into a kind of homecoming. This has become the poster child for a conference where the conference doesn't matter. It's really just the one week we all decide to be in California, as much for each other as Apple.

With the number of ticketless "showcializers" set to outnumber the number of actual attendees, and IndieDevLab merging with Appsterdam, AltWWDC 2013 promises to be the best unofficial side conference ever to side conference a conference. Whether you have a ticket or not, AltWWDC is <a href="http://altwwdc.com">your place</a> to sit down, plug in, and get some wifi, lunch, and maybe even some knowledge.
