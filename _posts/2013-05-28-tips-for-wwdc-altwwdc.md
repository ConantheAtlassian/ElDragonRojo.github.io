WWDC has been part of my life for over a decade now. It started as something I'd watch from afar, when my only career goal was to get there. When I finally made it in 2005, I met my mentor and put my career on the fast track. A couple of years later, my team won an Apple Design Award, and a couple of years after that, I actually got to help put on the show.

For the past couple of years, I've helped the Appsterdam Foundation build the conference around the conference, serving the growing number of ticketless showcializers, and leading this community exercise in providing solutions, instead of merely complaining. Inevitably, I've developed some top tips for new and returning attendees to our annual homecoming.

<strong>Be prepared.</strong> You can certainly just show up and see what happens, but like most things in life, you'll do a lot better if you take it seriously and start getting ready before you go. Pick some parties you want to attend and get on the RSVP lists. Think about what you want to accomplish, what you have to share with the community, and what you hope to bring home.

<strong>Carry cheap cigarettes.</strong> That has been my number one tip for years. A lot of the conference is actually spent standing on the sidewalk holding conversations with people you won't get to meet any other time. In a city like San Francisco, you're competing for their attention with a parade of panhandlers, and the fastest, cheapest way to keep them moving and get back to your conversations is to offer them a cigarette.

<strong>Bring your A game.</strong> This is your biggest and best chance to meet colleagues, future teammates, and media gatekeepers. Here, more than ever, you need to be hustling. <a href="http://newlemurs.com/blog/4-Lets-Trade">Don't come empty handed</a>. Be prepared to exchange business cards. If you hurry, you can still order some from MOO and get <a href="http://www.moo.com/share/h7dfxg">10% off</a>. Also, if you have an app, you should bring 2"x2" icon stickers to trade. Don't have any? There's still time to order those too. Go to StickerMule and get <a href="http://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=7501079601">$10 off</a>.

<strong>Go with the flow.</strong> Get it together now, because once you get there, it's up to fate. WWDC should always be a life-changing experience, but if you show up with a checklist, or try to recreate the same experience year after year, you're going to end up disappointed, and the conference will start to feel like it has passed you by. It's nice to see old friends, but come just as prepared to make new ones. Don't try to shape the experience; let the experience shape you.
