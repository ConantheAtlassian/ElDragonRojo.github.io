Although much of the world's technology is produced in Silicon Valley, people outside the industry don't directly benefit from that. The offices in the Valley don't have better workflows. The municipalities don't have better websites. It's like living next to an oil refinery, but not getting cheaper gas.



This is less than ideal, and our community outreach initiatives are intended to make sure locals benefit from the technology being produced by Appsterdam. The first such initiative, launching this week, is called <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/27210821/">Meet the Makers, powered by IceMobile</a>.



As opposed to Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures, which are likely to be technical talks of interest only to App Makers, Meet the Makers tells the story behind an app, and should be of general interest, understandable to anyone.



After hearing about the app, you are encouraged to literally meet the maker, to ask questions, and to give feedback. Not only should you get a good idea of what the app means for your life or your business, App Makers should get a good idea of how well they are serving you.



Here are the details of the upcoming event:

<blockquote>

Meet the Makers of ABN AMRO Mobile Banking on Thursday, August 4, 2011, 1:30 PM at the offices of IceMobile, Mensinge 2, 1083 HA Amsterdam. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/27210821/">RSVP</a>

</blockquote>



The Summer of Appsterdam was our plan for spending the summer building the world's most advanced infrastructure for App Makers. With this we've launched all the infrastructure building initiatives we announced at the launch party, and a few more besides.



<strong>I'd say phase one is going pretty well.</strong>
