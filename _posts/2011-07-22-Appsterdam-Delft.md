Given our goal of serving all the world's App Makers, the things Appsterdam builds are not intended to be exclusive to Amsterdam, but to duplicated in cities all over the world, franchised by other passionate people who share our vision of building community, encouraging unity, and fostering collaboration.



This is why it gives me great pleasure to introduce our first Appland location, Appsterdam Delft. Delft is a great location for Appsterdam, not just because it's convenient to people in South Holland, but because it is home to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delft_University_of_Technology">Technische Universiteit Delft</a>, the oldest and largest technical university in the Netherlands, sometimes called the Dutch MIT.



It's also a lovely town with a rich history, not unlike Amsterdam. We're kicking things off there just like we did here, with a Meeten en Drinken, this Wednesday (July 27) at 19:00 at:

Beestenmarkt 8

2611 GB Delft

Tel: 015-2123297



While we'll be having our regular Meeten en Drinken at Cafe Bax in Amsterdam at the same time, I and several other Appsterdammers will be in Delft to help kick things off, pass out stickers, and talk about the future of Appsterdam in Delft.



In addition to the evening's festivities, innovative ICT company and incubator SPING is offering its <a href="http://meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/26518151/">Grand Cafe to App Makers</a> for the day. Meet your colleagues and spend a couple of hours working beside them. SPING is providing WiFi, coffee, tea and lunch.
