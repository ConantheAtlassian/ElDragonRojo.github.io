You'll notice I always refer to App Makers and App Making. When Apple responded to Intellectual Venture in the guise of Lodsys, they referred to us as App Makers, and I liked the respect and legitimacy it engendered.



As for App Making, it goes back to what my journalism mentor, R.G. Gould, once said about the First Amendment: "You owe your living to it. You better damn well capitalize it."
