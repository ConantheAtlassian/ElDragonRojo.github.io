There's nutritious food, and there's delicious food, and thinking those are different types of food makes people fat, unhealthy, and sad. As long as the people who sell food that makes people fat, unhealthy, and sad are better at cooking, distributing, and marketing their products, people will continue to be fat, unhealthy, and sad. You can make all the excuses you want, but they don't actually do anything. The facts are what they are.

Once you accept the facts, you can decide whether you care about making the world a better place, and whether you have what it takes to actually solve this problem. This is what nature calls a niche, and there's an industry to be built selling food products that are not only better for you, but better in every way than food that is bad for you.

Solve that problem, and you will be the Apple of food. That's how Apple took over the mobile market. They said it doesn't matter why cell phones are lousy, it only matters that we make something that is not merely adequate, but a surprise and delight to use. It doesn't matter what you think of Apple. That's their big strategy. 

It's really quite simple. Figure out what the default option is, give people a reason to try your option, and make it easy for them to do so. Throw in something to talk about, and you've got the perfect product. The people selling things like politics, religion, and speculative investments are great at this. The people selling science, reason, and being good to your fellow man are using Comic Sans.

If you have what it takes, any market is yours, and make no mistake, that goes for every market, and that includes the marketplace of ideas. The reason things are falling apart and it feels like you're surrounded by idiots is the same reason you're surrounded by people who are fat, unhealthy and sadâ€”the bad guys pick better fonts.

It's not about the choice of typeface. It's about what the choice of typeface represents. I didn't even notice the typeface, because there was so much information <a href="http://www.anorak.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/higgs-boson.jpg">crammed</a> onto each slide, I thought I was at the world's most boring business meeting. Which is a real shame, because the product is amazing.

Science deserves to be treated better than this. Science isn't a bunch of nerds with no aesthetic taste. Science is the source of all our power. Science connects us to our place in the Cosmos. Science brings us closer to God. It's no wonder the forces of violence, materialism, and greed are so keen to keep us and our children away from it.
