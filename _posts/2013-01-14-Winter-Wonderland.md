The city is gearing back up after the new year shutdown, and the New Lemurs are no exception. Our first troop of lemur chemists have given us some great feedback to work on in earnest this week. I'm big into trying <a href="http://mur.mu.rs/?p=580">new things</a> this year: new ways of development, new ways to do business, and new adventures in the city.

This weekend Kitty and I went to not one but two museums—<a href="http://allardpiersonmuseum.nl/english/">Allard Pierson</a>, the university archeology museum, and <a href="http://www.kattenkabinet.nl/index.php?lang=en">Kattenkabinet</a>, an adorable museum dedicated to art featuring cats. We also had a mini adventure when we discovered that the wall on which Rembrant's famous "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch">Night Watch</a>" had originally hung was preserved inside the NH Doelen hotel, just around the corner from our little canal house.

Amsterdam is a treasure trove of history and adventure, which is why the <a href="http://www.amsterdammuseum.nl/en">Amsterdam Museum</a> is so mind-bogglingly massive—not that you'd notice from its many hidden doorways, so indicative of this facet of the city. It's no coincidence <a href="http://www.annefrank.org">Anne Frank</a>'s family managed to remain hidden for so long. The buildings, like the people, hide rich interiors behind inscrutable facades.

Or so I hear. I've never actually been inside the Amsterdam Museum—a wrong I'm finally going to right this Sunday with 19 of my closest friends on the official Appsterdam tour. There are still <a href="http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/87026352/">a few slots left</a>, and everyone is welcome, so whether you were born on a bike or are new to the city, I hope you'll join us on what promises to be a fun day with friends.

If you're looking for something a bit more adventuresome and dare I say booze-soaked, you'll be pleased to know that for the third year running, Cocoaheads Bremen are inviting Appsterdammers to cross the border in more ways than one for the annual Kohlfahrt. <a href="http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/99446672/">Don't miss out</a> on your chance to experience this unique northern German custom.

Speaking of not missing out, Amsterdam's own <a href="http://rockstart.com">Rockstart</a> accelerator program is accepting applications for their second class. If you've ever been to <a href="http://startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend</a> and wanted to take that experience to the next level, this is your second chance. This is just one of thousands of opportunities for technologists in this city <a href="http://meetup.appsterdam.rs">planned</a> or <a href="http://appsterdam.rs/events">tracked</a> by Appsterdam.

I know it's dark and cold outside, making it easy to get depressed, which is exactly why you should get out and meet some people. We celebrate the summer as a time for getting together with our friend, but the dreary winter is when we need institutions like Appsterdam the most. I'm shaking things up this year. Aren't you?
