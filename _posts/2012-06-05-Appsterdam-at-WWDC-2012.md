WWDC is my holiday week. Maybe you have the week between Christmas and New Year, but for me, it's WWDC. It's the time when I'm called home to give an accounting of my work year to 5000 of my friends and colleagues. 

How important is this week to me? I timed the launch of Appsterdam for right after the last WWDC, so I'd have the longest possible time to be ready for the next WWDC, which is next week. I'm pleased to say that with the team I built, and the things we've done together, there's a lot to say.

But why say what you can show? Which is why we're bringing the spirit of Appsterdam to WWDC. Our friends at StackMob are turning their HQ into an Appsterdam hangout, where the ticketed and ticketless alike are welcome to unload, plug in, and meet their fellow App Makers, just like we do here in Amsterdam, and in embassy cities around the world. 

We're going to have sponsored lunchtime lectures, not just Wednesday, but everyday. I'm going to be delivering my new talk, "The Most Important Minute of Your Life." There will also be talks from Victor Agreda, Jr, Danny Greg, Matt Vaznaian, Jason Harris, and Nathan Eror, who's so influential, he inspired my recent vegan diet.

We're also going to have a special keynote breakfast on Monday, where we'll watch the blog feeds and showcialize over donuts and bagels. 

Given the fact WWDC sold out in less than 2 hours, we're expecting demand to far outstrip supply, so we're partnering with <a href="http://www.indiedevlab.com/">IndieDevLab</a> at The Box, who have their own set of lectures, timed with ours so as to not overlap, from such indie heroes as Ben Zadik, Jay "Saurik" Freeman, Dan Grover, and Nate True, my old homie. That's twice the space, twice the lectures, and twice the showcializing opportunities.

Since the guys behind IndieDevLab and I worked at Tapulous during the dawn of the app ecosystem, we're going to host a reunion panel on how we survived the Big Bang, Monday afternoon at 3. It promises to be the kind of rare and folkloric event you can only put together at WWDC.

The Big Show has had a night scene for years, but given the fact that more and more people are coming without tickets—and that we're all getting older—we're going to see a day scene this year like never before. For more information, and to let us know you're coming, visit the Appsterdam HQ at WWDC <a href="http://robelkin.com/wwdc">home page</a>.

I hope to see you there, and with that, a quick note from our Chief Community Officer, Judy Chen:

<blockquote>
Both IndieDevLab and Appsterdam will be using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23AltWWDC">#AltWWDC</a> so be sure to use that when tweeting about us! In addition, we'll have our #Appsterdam IRC channel on Freenode to communicate with our friends abroad (irc://freenode.org/appsterdam).
