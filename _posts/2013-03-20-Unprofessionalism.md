I'm a very lucky man, and one of the things that makes me so lucky are my friends. These are the nicest, most talented people I've met in my life, and many of them have skills that have made them vital contributors to my success over the years—not only in making my products and building my brands, but in getting my message out there (for what it's worth). For example, a bunch of them have started great podcasts with unbelievable guest lists, which they have generously allowed me to be part of.

My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/casademora">Saul Mora</a> has assembled one of the finest collections of interviews in our industry with his <a href="http://nsbrief.com">NSBrief</a> podcast. Seriously, look at his <a href="http://nsbrief.com/archive/">archive</a>—it's like a who's who of NSCoders, and he's had me on not <a href="http://nsbrief.com/11-appsterdam">once</a>, but <a href="http://nsbrief.com/84-mike-lee">twice</a>.

What's cool about NSBrief is that the audience is just as illustrious as the guest list. Both times I've been on the show, I've ended up getting amazing, life-changing feedback from its audience. Most recently, I talked about trying to blend consulting with making our own apps, and ended up basically having the implementation details of that handed to me after the show.

Short version: we're setting thresholds for when our consulting flag goes up or down. If we drop below 3 months burn, we have to accept consulting until we get back up to 12 months burn. Since we don't have capacity for business development, we're doing all our contracting through <a href="http://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> Europe. (So if you'd like to hire us, <a href="mailto:europe@bignerdranch.com">contact</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/marcelspeller">Marcel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bolot">Bolot</a>!)

My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/dwiskus">Dave Wiskus</a> and I were recently able to celebrate our strange relationship on his show, <a href="http://unprofesh.com">Unprofessional</a>. Because Dave is the protege of my protege,  I am always busting his balls. He wanted to do a show themed around being offensive, so I spent the whole show pretending to hate the show (which I actually love) and ripping on Dave (who I actually love).

It's a beautiful piece of <a href="http://unprofesh.com/blog/2013/1/2/21-motherbleeper-mike-lee">performance art</a>. At one point I even insulted Dave while the call was muted, an act so dickish it calls to mind the old Dutch expression, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlandish_Proverbs">wipe one's ass on the door</a>. I had a really good time. Given how successful the show has been, it should come as no surprise that Dave (and everybody's best friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/lexfri">Lex Friedman</a>) are not only genuinely great people, but incredibly good sports.

Finally, although the episode is not up yet, I had the great pleasure of being interviewed by my old pal <a href="https://twitter.com/gte">Guy English</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie">Rene Ritchie</a> on their show, <a href="http://www.imore.com/tag/debug">Debug</a>. I was so excited when they started this show, because of Guy's skill as a conversationalist. Really, of all the many things to envy him for, that's the one I envy the most.

Maybe it's my internal journalism major, but I always pay attention to people's interview styles. Saul sets up the guests and lets them talk. Dave and Lex relate to their guests by sharing their own anecdotes. Guy and Rene ask probing follow-up questions to encourage their guests to dive deep in exploring their topics.

I know the key to great conversations is asking great follow-up questions, but that's easier said that done. I've always admired Guy for this, and I listen to their show as much for the interviews as for a case study on how to talk to  people. 

That's what makes me respect my friends so damned much—they have so much to teach me, just by doing the things I can't.
