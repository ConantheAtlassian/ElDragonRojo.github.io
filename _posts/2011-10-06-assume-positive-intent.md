Today, as I began carefully sifting through the emotional minefield of my inbox, I got this:

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://mur.mu.rs/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Absolutely_Unacceptable1.png" alt="Absolutely Unacceptable" title="Absolutely_Unacceptable.png" border="0" width="684" height="963" />

Clearly the person tasked with sending this email was so distraught over the news that they accidentally typed the thing foremost on their mind into the subject field and forgot to fill in the other fields before, overcome with grief, they hit send. 

I understand completely.

<strong>Inevitable Update</strong>

Today I received the inevitable follow-up to what was obviously someone's goof.

<img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://mur.mu.rs/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Inevitable_Followup.png" alt="Inevitable Followup" title="Inevitable_Followup.png" border="0" width="654" height="759" />

These guys also reached out to me personally to let me know how incredibly sick they were at their mistake. The good news is, it was just an honest-to-goodness error and not something more sinister. This is why we always assume positive intent.
