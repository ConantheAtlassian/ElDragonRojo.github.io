Fill your noggin and get your fill of nog in, at a very special Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lecture.



They said <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22it+couldn't+be+done%22">it couldn't be done</a>. They said <a href="https://twitter.com/matmanferdini/status/146910509369794560">it was too close to Christmas</a>. They said <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22we+were+crazy+to+even+try%22">we were crazy to even try</a>.



Then it turned out <a href="http://twitter.com/globalmoxie">Josh Clark</a> was in town. Josh is the author of <a href="http://www.bol.com/nl/p/engelse-boeken/tapworthy/1001004008258857/index.html">Tapworthy</a>, the definitive explanation of why your app sucks. Josh graciously agreed to speak at next week's lecture.



Then, for some reason, eggnog was <a href="https://twitter.com/appsterdamrs/status/146962424854085632">mentioned</a>.



Come see Josh Clark, drink some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggnog">eggnog</a>, and watch Josh Clark drink some eggnog. 



Normally we bring broodje toppings to the lunchtime lectures, but I suppose this time we should bring our favorite holiday treats.



Same time, same place: Wednesday, Dec. 21, 12:30 at Innovatielab on the top floor of Vijzelstraat 20.
