Title:
Popup Appsterdam at Picnic

Body:
People have been asking for months when we're having another major event, and I've been alluding to something in mid-September in connection with Picnic. I'm pleased to announce <a href="http://www.appsterdam.com/">Popup Appsterdam</a> at Picnic, September 14-16, at NDSM-Werf.

The idea of Popup Appsterdam is to present a compressed version of the world's most advanced infrastructure for App Makers, by App Makers. You can experience a healthy sampling of what Appsterdam is, which is, in a word, apps. If you are an App Maker, need an app made, have an idea for an app, or just like apps, Appsterdam is for you.

It goes without saying our tent will be an Appsterdam Approved Hangout, and people will be hacking non-stop on the <a href="http://mur.mu.rs/?p=307">free money circuit</a> (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/31540032/">RSVP</a>), including some pretty fantastic prizes in the Sanoma App Challenge. You're welcome to bring your code and seek help from your colleagues, and Appsterdam Guru Sessions may end up popping up as needed.

Fun as it may be to watch nerds work, there will be plenty else for regular folk as well. We'll be running Meet the Makers, where App Makers will be showing off their masterpieces. Several App Makers will be debuting apps there. It's a great chance for anyone to not only come see the latest apps, but to literally Meet the Makers.

And of course we'll have plenty of friendly folks in Appsterdam shirts answering questions and passing out stickers. This will notably be the first time the organization is running without its mayor, as I have speaking engagements stateside, so come out and give them your support.

Our hosts at <a href="http://www.bita-center.com/">bITa Center / iCE Amsterdam</a>, who have been major contributors to Appsterdam since the movement began, are also preparing a whole program of special guests, which should present a nice cross section of home-grown technology.

And let us not forget <a href="http://picnicnetwork.org/">Picnic</a>, which is a major event in and of itself, although, <strong>you do not have to attend Picnic to attend Popup Appsterdam</strong>.
