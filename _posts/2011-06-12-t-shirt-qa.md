I mentioned yesterday that you can pre-order T-shirts until noon on Monday, which generated a flurry of questions. Since time is of the essence, I will address these here.

<strong>What's the deal?</strong>

We're celebrating Appsterdam launch party weekend by having a small batch of hand-printed T-shirts professionally silkscreened. Since that doesn't necessarily guarantee we'll have enough shirts in your size, we're letting you pre-purchase your shirt before we put in the order at noon on Monday.

<strong>What will they look like?</strong>

The simplified Appsterdam logo in red and black expertly silkscreened onto a light gray T-shirt. You can imagine something like our awesome <a href="http://appsterdam.rs">teaser site</a>, but with fewer words, and as a T-shirt.

<strong>Are there women's sizes?</strong>

Of course, but you will definitely want to pre-order these, as we're unlikely to have many at the party.

<strong>When do we get them?</strong>

You can pick-up your shirts at the party on Saturday night. If you can't make it to the party, but still want a shirt, we can ship one to you, but only if you pre-order it by noon on Monday.

<strong>How much does it cost?</strong>

The shirts are €20 if you pick them up at the party. If you need us to ship it to you, it's an additional €5 in the Netherlands, €10 international, for up to 3 shirts.
