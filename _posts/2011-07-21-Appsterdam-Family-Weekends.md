When we talk about Appsterdam, we talk about App Makers, and when we talk about App Makers, we talk about nerds. Maybe they're programmers, or designers, or lawyers, but they're all nerds in their own way. But Appsterdam is about more than nerds getting together.



Even in the Netherlands, App Makers on a project leave their families. We might be sleeping at home, but we're not there. We're at the office for ungodly hours, distracted behind the eyes, and generally unavailable to tend to our families' needs.



Having our families involved increases our diversity and makes our community more welcoming to a wider range of people. They also keep us in line. I firmly believe if people had brought their partners to WWDC, none of the hullabaloo from the after parties would have happened. We don't call them our better halves for nothing.



That's why it's important not just to get the nerds together, but also to get our families together. When our families get to know each other, they will be able to build their own community, and their own support network. This will be especially important for families that move to Appsterdam.



Getting to know each other's families will also help us to get to know each other better. It is one step past the Meeten en Drinken on the path to forming true friendships within our community. Those friendships are vital in building an ecosystem that allows us all to mind our businesses.



This is why I am particularly pleased to announce that our first Appsterdam Family Weekend event will be happening on Saturday, July 23, at the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam. All members are welcome, and encouraged to bring their families. We'll meet at the zoo at a time to be determined and take this fantastic urban safari together.



Please bring cash to pay for your admission to the event. The prices are as follows:

<ul>

<li>Adults (10 years +) € 28,50</li>

<li>Children (3 to 9 years) € 25,00</li>

<li>Artis members (3 years +) € 11,50</li>

</ul>
