Title:
Behold, A White Elephant

Body:
People own a lot of crap, and people give a lot of gifts, so it stands to reason that people give and get a lot of crap as gifts. As such, we all own things that we don't really want, but that we can't really get rid of, because they were gifts, and there's a social contract. These are the white elephants.

You can probably think of something like that in your life. Now imagine wrapping that thing and giving it to someone who will love itâ€”or at least share in your horrible fascination for it. The white elephant gift exchange is an attempt to shuffle the gene pool of crap, because one person's crap is another person's craving, or something like that.

The best way to determine who gets what is of course in armed combat, but due to Dutch nautical regulations, we'll end up playing some sort of silly game instead. It should be a lot of fun, and you'll be surprised the things people will end up fighting over. This is one situation where the giving is definitely better than the getting!

This American tradition will be at the centerpiece of the Appsterdam Holiday Gathering this Sunday, Dec. 18., which will take place at Appsterdam Noord, the Appsterdam Approved Hangout at NDSM Wharf, with a meal on the fabulously adjacent <a href="http://pannenkoekenboot.nl">Pannenkoekenboot</a>, because it's hard to think of anything more Dutch than eating pancakes on a boat.

So grab your unwanted crap and some enticing wrapping paper and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/42349492/">RSVP<a> for the family-friendly, crap-swapping, pancake-scarfing, boat-riding holiday extravaganza of a lifetime. Space is limited, but if you RSVP by Thursday afternoon, we can reserve more space on the boat.
