This weekend the Appsterdam movement launched the Summer of Appsterdam, our first set of initiatives for building the City of Apps. We'll have the whole summer to talk more about that. For now, I want to tell you about the actual event. I think—I'm not 100% positive, but I think—we managed to throw the <i>greatest launch party of all time</i>.

Lots of people have launch parties, and a lot of them are really great, but most of them only last one night. Our launch party lasted the <i>entire weekend</i>. 

Festivities began on Friday night, as people arrived from all over the world to join with local App Makers in taking over the bar terrace of 't Loosje. We spent the night getting to know each other over drinks and snacks overlooking the historic Waag building, home of the city's open data initiative.

On Saturday morning, attendees had their choice of six tours around the city, each lovingly assembled and expertly delivered by local guides. These were not just touristic strolls through  shopping streets. I mean, just look at the program for the <a href="http://www.camerize.com/Appsterdam.html">Appstars tour</a>. That was just one of the adventures shared by each group of App Makers, each giving them a chance to get to know Appsterdam and each other.

Saturday night, we got together at Panama for a big launch party, sponsored by Igluu and Vodafone. I took the stage and delivered a keynote featuring people and companies in Appsterdam. We also had iPad stands where people could see what their fellow Appsterdammers have been working on. 

During the party we introduced our <a href="http://appsterdam.rs">website</a>, our summer initiatives, our new and upcoming Appsterdam Noord and Appsterdam Centraal workspaces, and the Appsterfund, a collection of entrepreneurs and investors dedicated to providing Appsterdammers with the help they need to build their companies. 

The room crackled with excitement and enthusiasm. People loaded up on T-shirts and stickers, as well as swag and discounts donated to the movement. Friends were made. Business was conducted. Products were launched. Companies were founded.

In addition to the planned events, Friday and Saturday nights we had Appsterdam After Dark, where groups of App Makers went out to experience the unique nightlife that has made Amsterdam famous. If you think you love your colleagues after a night out drinking, imagine how you feel after a night out in Amsterdam.

On Sunday, we had a hangout-warming hangover brunch at Appsterdam Noord on the NDSM-werf. Again, local App Makers gave of themselves, bringing their favorite toppings for that most Dutch of meals: <i>diverse broodje</i>. We ate, drank, and talked on the bank of the IJ, giving us all a glimpse into our future.

The sun shone down on the exhausted but invigorated App Makers and their families as they said their goodbyes and made plans to return. People trickled out to catch their planes, trains, and buses, or got on their bikes and rolled out in search of dinner.

Guided tours of Amsterdam. A family-friendly picnic. The most livable city in the world. Consider the bar raised.

But the real story of the Appsterdam Launch Party Weekend is not how great it was, but how it happened in the first place. We had no money, no patron, no company behind us. People produced a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=xLzkQjO0j_k">video</a> and a <a href="http://appsterdamrs.s3.amazonaws.com/magazine/appsterdam_magazine_v1.pdf">magazine</a>, put together tours, built a website, found sponsors, and took care of a million little details necessary to pull this weekend off without a hitch.

This launch was not my doing, but the work of some two dozen dedicated and passionate volunteers—people and companies who spent their time and money, working together to achieve something great for the good of all App Makers.

This weekend not only introduced Appsterdam to the world, it also validated the movement behind it. Can your launch party do this?
