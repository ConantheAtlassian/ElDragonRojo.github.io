With all the great initiatives we've launched, there are so many chances for you to participate in the Summer of Appsterdam, it can be hard to keep track of them all. Here's a quick summary of where the action is in Appsterdam:

<blockquote>

<strong>Appsterdam Approved Hangouts</strong> are a place for you to bring your laptop and get some work done alongside other App Makers. Our first facility, Appsterdam Noord, is currently in beta testing at NDSM Wharf. It's open Tuesdays and Thursdays. There's no charge, but <a href="http://meetup.com/Appsterdam">let us know you're coming</a>.

<strong>Weekly Wednesday Lunchtime Lectures</strong>, hosted by SourceTag, are educational business lunches presented by your fellow Appsterdammers. These happen every Wednesday at 12:30 at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Vijzelstraat+20,+Amsterdam&hl=en&sll=51.981541,5.907291&sspn=1.703513,2.524109&z=17">Vijzelstraat 20</a>. Presentations are recorded and put online, so even if you can't make it, you can still benefit. There's no charge to attend, but bring your favorite sandwich filling to share.

<strong>Appsterdam Meeten en Drinken</strong> are informal get-togethers at cafes and bars around the city. This is a chance for you and your partner to have a night out surrounded by colleagues. We get together like this about once a week, and while you're free to just show up, you can RSVP and see who's coming on our <a href="http://meetup.com/Appsterdam">Meetup site</a>.

<strong>Appsterdam Family Weekends</strong> are fun outings for App Makers and their families, and your best chance to really get to know your fellow Appsterdammers. Our first one will be on Saturday, July 23, at the Artis Zoo here in Amsterdam. Please <a href="http://appsterdam.rs/rsvp">let us know you're coming</a>, and bring cash for admission.

</blockquote>

In addition to these recurring events, Appsterdam also participates in other events, such as next weekend's <a href="http://iosdevcamp.org">iOSDevCamp</a>, and this September's <a href="http://picnicnetwork.org">PICNIC festival</a>. News of the former is coming soon, and planning for the latter is happening <a href="http://meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/24220591">next Friday in Bloemendaal</a>.

You're also likely to run into Appsterdammers at any one of the many technical and cultural events constantly happening in the city. We maintain a "concert calendar" of all our events at the <a href="http://appsterdam.rs/events">Appsterdammers</a> site, and will soon include other events of interest to Appsterdammers.
