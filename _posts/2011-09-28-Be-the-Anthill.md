We've been mum since announcing the <a href="http://mur.mu.rs/?p=303">Appsterdam Legal Defense Initiative</a>, busy organizing things behind the scenes. We're now ready to start signing people up and accepting donations, which you can help us with by visiting the official Operation Anthill <a href="http://appsterdamlegalfoundation.org/">web site</a>. You can connect to Operation Anthill on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Appsterdam-Legal-Foundation/275805859096465">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/optanthill">Twitter</a>, hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23anthill">#anthill</a>.



We're organizing a legal summit in Appsterdam somewhere between October 3-15. We're thinking 2 days, with a day of presentations and a day of workshops. I'm letting you know now so you can start clearing your schedule. I'll give you the exact dates as soon as possible, so you can book travel. 



Whether you're being extorted with patents now, or are afraid for the future, this will be your chance to get the legal advice you need to protect your business.
