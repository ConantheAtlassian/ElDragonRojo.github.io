Title:
Taking a Stand

Body:
News from the front has not been promising. Tech blogs read like Tolkien short stories. Our colleagues are being overrun by patent trolls. <a href="http://widgetpress.com/defense">Widget Press</a> is about to fall, and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20079959-38/kootol-targets-microsoft-apple-others-over-patent/">Iconfactory</a> may be next. 

None of us are ready to take up this fight, but if we don't bring the fight to them, they're going to bring the fight to us. 

At this point we have two options. We continue business as usual, going along our separate paths, spending each day praying we are not the next to fall. Or we stand together, here and now, and fight back. 

Abandon the notion that lawyers are our enemies. There are many lawyers who would like to help stop this misuse of patent law. I know because when lawyers and others want to help App Makers, they contact the Appsterdam movement. 

Our goal is to serve the interests of App Makers all over the world, and there is no greater interest than fighting the destruction of our industry, our businesses, and our way of life.

Let this be our rallying cry. We're starting by putting the call out for attorneys and patent experts who would like to help assemble a legal team: email bmf at le.mu.rs. 

In a few weeks, we'll set up a legal defense fund to fuel that team. Then we will formulate and implement a strategy to fight these bastards.

Together, we will get the message across: <strong>If you come after indies, we will come after you.</strong> They can afford to fight, but we cannot afford to lose.
