Appsterdam is the best place in the world to be an App Maker. One of the things that makes that is true is the number of coding contests held here. We're getting to the point where it's not such a crazy idea to actually live on the free money circuit, each demo propelling your company toward launch. 



<blockquote>

<a href="http://www.appsfornoordholland.nl/summary-of-contest-in-english">Apps for Noord Holland</a> is the latest in a series of government-sponsored hackathons that award cash prizes for apps using open data.



<a href="http://www.sanomamedia.nl/nl-web-Nieuws-App_Challenge-App_Challenge_English_.php">Sanoma App Challenge</a> is an open call for ideas, with an awesome prize for best entry. This year's contest will involve a hackathon in the Appsterdam tent at <a href="http://www.picnicnetwork.org/">Picnic</a>.



<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cwsnlcomp/">Google</a> is hosting a competition for Chrome apps for its Dutch Web Store. The best apps will win free Chromebooks and prominent placement.

Shipping a product takes months, but most contests only require a proof of concept, which takes hours. When you're trying to get started, or are interested in exploring new ideas, contests are a good way to go. 



In addition to cash and prizes, winning contests is a great way to make a name for yourself, and the events around them often bring introductions to connections and opportunities. Sometimes the people you meet even losing a contest are worth more than the prize!



Coding contests are also the perfect opportunity to check out a new platform. What better motivator to learn a new skill than the chance to win something in the process?
